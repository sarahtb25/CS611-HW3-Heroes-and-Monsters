********************
|   Market Rules   |
********************

1.  The heroes can buy and sell items at any market. Items that are sold at every market are:
    (1) Armors
    (2) Potions
    (3) Spells
    (4) Weapons
2.  Each hero has a private wallet (their gold amount) and does not share money with the other heroes.
    Likewise, each hero has their own inventory of items that they do not share with their fellow heroes.
3.  A hero can sell an item that is not consumable i.e. potions and spells cannot be sold.

    Money earned by hero after a successful sale = 0.5 * the item's cost

    The item will be removed from the player's inventory.
4.  A successful purchase will reduce the amount of money the hero has, and the item will be transferred to
    the hero’s inventory.
5.  All items have a name, a price, and a level. A hero cannot buy:
    (1) an item that costs more than the money they have, or
    (2) an item that is a higher level than they are.
6.  You can provide the following commands (Not case-sensitive):
    (1) View Market: To view the items in the market

----------------
|  Item Types  |
----------------

1.  Armor: Armor reduces the incoming damage from a monster’s attack. A piece of armor has
    a name, a price, a level, and a damage reduction value. When equipped, armor will reduce
    the damage taken by the hero by its damage reduction value. A hero can equip at most one
    piece of armor at a time.
2.  Potions: Potions can be used by a hero in order to increase one of their statistics by some
    amount. Potions are multi-use items, and each potion can be consumed a different number of times.
    Potions have a name, a price, a level, and an effect amount. Using the potion should
    increase the given statistic by the effect amount. There are potions for increasing hit points, mana,
    strength, dexterity, and agility.
3.  Spells. A spell represents a magic attack performed by a hero. A spell has a name, a price, a
    level, a damage value, a mana cost, and a spell type. A hero will require at least the mana
    cost amount of mana to cast the spell. Therefore, if a hero has no mana, that hero cannot cast
    any spells. The damage value is used along with the hero’s dexterity value to calculate the
    damage dealt during a spell cast move in a battle.

    Hero’s spell damage = spell_base_damage + (dexterity/10000) * spell_base_damage

    After casting a spell, the mana cost is deducted from the hero’s mana.
    Spells also have an additional effect besides their damage.

    The types of spell and their effects are:
    (1) Ice spell: reduces the amount of damage the target can cause
    (2) Fire spell: reduces the defense of the target
    (3) Lightning spell: reduces the dodge chance of the target

4.  Weapons: A weapon is used by a hero to attack a monster. A weapon has a name, a price, a
    level, a damage value, and the number of hands required to use it. A weapon must be
    equipped by the hero before it can be used. The damage value is used to calculate the
    damage dealt during an attack move in a battle.

    Hero's attack damage with weapon= (hero's strength + weapon_damage) * 0.05


********************
|   Battle Rules   |
********************

1.  This is a turn-based battle, where the heroes make a move first, followed by the monster
2.  The battle is 1-on-1 i.e. one hero vs one monster
3.  The battle ends when
    (1) the hero runs out of hit points, or
    (2) the monster runs out of hit points
4.  Possible commands to use in battle (Not case-sensitive):
    (1) Change <Weapon or Armor ID>: To update the weapon or armor a hero is or is not carrying/wearing e.g. R0 change B0
    (2) Hit: To hit the monster with the weapon the hero is carrying
    (3) Cast <Spell ID>: To cast a spell on the monster e.g. Cast F0
    (4) I/i: To view the details of the hero and the monster engaged in battle (Will not lose a turn)
    (5) Q/q: To quit the game
    (6) H/h: To view possible commands for battle (Will not lose a turn)
    (7) R/r: To view the rules of battle (Will not lose a turn)
5.  Commands that do not have (Will not lose a turn) means that if the item ID given does not exist,
    the hero loses a turn.
6.  The monsters will only attack the heroes, as they do not have items or spells to use.
7.  Heroes have a dodge chance that will allow them to occasionally avoid taking damage from a monster’s attack.
    If the dodge chance >= monster's attack, then the monster's attack is dodged. Otherwise, the hero gets the full
    brunt of the monster's attack - defence provided by the hero's armor (if any).

    Hero's dodge chance = hero's agility * 0.2

8.  Similarly, monsters also have a dodge chance that will allow them to occasionally avoid taking damage from
    a hero’s attack. If the dodge chance >= hero's attack, then the hero's attack is dodged. Otherwise, the monster
    gets the full brunt of the hero's attack - monster's defence.

    Monster's dodge points = monster's dodge chance * 0.1

9.  When a monster is unable to dodge the hero's spell, the monster faces a loss in skill. The skill affected
    depends on the type of spell used.
    The types of spell and their effects are:
    (1) Ice spell: reduces the amount of damage the monster can cause
    (2) Fire spell: reduces the defense of the monster
    (3) Lightning spell: reduces the dodge chance of the monster

    Skill left after getting hit by spell = (damage or defence or dodge chance, depending on type of spell) * 0.9

10. If a hero wins the battle, the hero gains 10% of their starting hit point and mana. They also get money and
    experience points.

    Money gained = Monster level * 100
    Experience gained = 2 * number of monster in battle, which is 1

11. Heroes are able to level up. Once they level up, their hit points, mana and experience level increases.
    When a hero levels up all of their skills increase by 5% and their favored skills increase by an extra 5%.

    Experience points needed to level up = Hero's current level * 10
    Hero's hit point = hero's current level * 100
    Hero's mana after level up = Hero's mana before level up * 1.1
    Hero's experience level after level up = Hero's experience level before level up + 1

12. After all the heroes who were able to battle have battled a monster, if the number of heroes who won is more
    than the number of monsters, then heroes who fainted in battle are revived. They gain back 50% of
    their starting hit points and their mana. However, they do not get any gold or experience.

--------------
|   Heroes   |
--------------

1. A hero has several attributes:
   (1) A name
   (2) A level with an amount of experience points
   (3) HP (hit points, the hero’s in battle)
   (4) MP (mana or magic points, for casting spells)
   (5) A strength value
   (6) A dexterity value
   (7) An agility value
   (8) An amount of gold
   (9) An inventory of items
   (10) The weapon and/or armor they have on them

2.  A hero has a level, representing how strong (or not) that hero is. Experience points determine the hero’s level.
    A hero levels up after accumulating enough experience points. A hero’s skills increase when the hero levels up.
    A hero never loses experience. It accumulates over the course of the game.
3.  HP (hot point): HP is the hero’s current health. The initial HP value is determined by hero’s level.

    Hero's hit points = Hero's current level * 100

    When a hero levels up, they have their HP set according to the same formula.

4.  MP: MP (or mana) is used to cast spells.
5.  Strength: A hero’s strength increases the amount of damage they deal when using a weapon.
6.  Dexterity: A hero’s dexterity increases the amount of damage they deal when casting a spell.
7.  Agility: A hero’s agility increases their chance to dodge a monster’s attack.
8.  Money: Money is for use in the market.
9.  Inventory. A hero has a collection of items that they have bought during the game. At the
    start of the game, the inventory is empty. There is no maximum size of the inventory.
10. There are three types of heroes, each with their own balance of skills:
    (1) Warriors are favored on strength and agility.
    (2) Sorcerers are favored on dexterity and agility.
    (3) Paladins are favored on strength and dexterity.

----------------
|   Monsters   |
----------------

1.  A monster has several attributes:
    (1) A name
    (2) A level
    (3) HP
    (4) A base damage value
    (5) A defense value
    (6) A dodge ability

2.  Base damage. This is a monster’s attack damage.
3.  Defense. Monsters don’t wear armor, relying on their natural hides and carapaces to
    protect them from the heroes’ attacks. This value reduces the amount of damage a monster
    takes from a hero’s attack or spell.
4.  Dodge ability. This represents how well a monster can avoid a hero’s attack. It functions in a
    similar way to the hero’s agility.
5.  There are three kinds of monsters, each with a favored attribute:
    (1) Dragons have increased base damage.
    (2) Exoskeletons have increased defense.
    (3) Spirits have increased dodge ability.
